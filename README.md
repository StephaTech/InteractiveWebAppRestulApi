CA1 Interactive Web Applications
This is a CA1 forked from Mikhail github
The idea was transformed the cafe Menu in a BookShop Menu selecting black womans writers from my own book list of 2020 
Separating in categories: 
BestSelllers;
Teen & Young Adult;
Literature & Fiction;
Biographies & Memoirs;
Book Awards differentiating using boolean
I love to read so I decided to select the books I read in 2020 + the prices I payed so is quite a recomendation of books and maybe can be a wish -list for some one
for one more month of lockdown 2021.
As this project was forked I used the same technologies and data structured for stored
xml - stands for Extensible Markup Language, xml tags identify the data and are used to store and organize the data, rather than specifying how to display it like HTML tags, which are used to display the data.
because we learned in class and it was less complicated in my mind than JSON even thought JSON is getting more popular now a days than xml.
HTML index and boostrap interface it was applied for the visual presentation
CSS and javascript for the functions and and representation of the data client-side 
Node js wasnt applied
Security wasnt applied
