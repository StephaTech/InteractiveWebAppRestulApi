Module Learning Outcomes Assessed MLO1 Assess the limitations of static Web solutions and design dynamic interactive web application solutions using a variety of industry standard Web application APIs and technologies MLO4 Analyse existing web applications needs to further integrate new cross-site communications services MLO5 Review and critique currently available development frameworks to aid user experience and recently developed technologies for future implementation MLO7 Design embeddable services that can integrate simple web applications into hosted web services

Assignment Description Choose an area of your interest to design, create and deploy an interactive web app that incorporates: 
[30%] Create an API service (you must use Node.js and MongoDB) that supports full CRUD for your existing CA1 app 
[30%] Update your existing CA1 app to allow populating the HTML table with JSON data provided by the API, implement the ability to Add and Delete items from that table using your new API
only from your front-end. You are free to use any available frontend frameworks/plugins to implement that functionality (Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, etc.) 
[15%] Deploy your application to Heroku and your database to MongoDB Atlas. Possess a coherent commit history on GitHub (at least 8 valid and logical commits) and
have your final submission code present in your Git repository 
[15%] You have to record a video screencast (10 minutes max) showing how your app works and how exactly you decided to go about making it. You should use your CCT Google Drive to store it and
 put the link into the final PDF submission. Make sure you set the correct permissions for sharing it or otherwise it will not be possible to see the video 
 [10%] The finished application should be accompanied by a report (5 pages max) that outlines the difference between the existing CA1 and the resulting CA2 apps, 
 reviews which approach was better in your opinion (CA1 vs. CA2) and explains the reasons of choosing a particular framework/plugin for your app at Step 2. 
 The cover sheet for the report should include a full student name, student number, project title, the projectâ€™s GitHub repository link and the link to the deployed application on Heroku.

CA1 Interactive Web Applications
This is a CA1 forked from Mikhail github
The idea was transformed the cafe Menu in a BookShop Menu selecting black womans writers from my own book list of 2020 
Separating in categories: 
BestSelllers;
Teen & Young Adult;
Literature & Fiction;
Biographies & Memoirs;
Book Awards differentiating using boolean
I love to read so I decided to select the books I read in 2020 + the prices I payed so is quite a recomendation of books and maybe can be a wish -list for some one
for one more month of lockdown 2021.
As this project was forked I used the same technologies and data structured for stored
xml - stands for Extensible Markup Language, xml tags identify the data and are used to store and organize the data, rather than specifying how to display it like HTML tags, which are used to display the data.
because we learned in class and it was less complicated in my mind than JSON even thought JSON is getting more popular now a days than xml.
HTML index and boostrap interface it was applied for the visual presentation
CSS and javascript for the functions and and representation of the data client-side 
Node js wasnt applied
Security wasnt applied
